# Campaigns

## Overview

Campaigns represent advertising campaigns that run on a network. Each campaign belongs to a single network and a single advertiser.

## ID Management

Campaigns follow the standardized three-tier ID system:
- **`broadstreet_id`**: Broadstreet API identifier (number) - for synced campaigns
- **`mongo_id`**: MongoDB ObjectId (string) - for local storage and local-only campaigns
- **`_id`**: MongoDB native ObjectId - for internal database operations only

## Parents relationship
Campaigns are children of advertisers and networks.
Campaigns are parents of placements (combinations of advertisements and zones).



**CRITICAL**
- if a value is not required and it is not provided, it will not be included in the request body.
- other than the id, we never rely on another id.
- when we open a campaign creation form, we DO NOT have a campaign id. We also dont give it any. We do that only on save.
- fields required by the broadstreet api that are required need to present. They are almost always in the filters section of the sidebar. e.g. network id and advertiser id are required. If not present, give message.
- in campaign duplicate names are allowed.


## How to create a campaign

Use the Broadstreet API to create a campaign for a specific advertiser.

- Required:
  - `access_token` (query) ‚Äì found in your environment
  - `name` (body, required)
  - `advertiser_id` (body, required) ‚Äì the Broadstreet advertiser to attach the campaign to
- Endpoint: `POST https://api.broadstreetads.com/api/1/campaigns`
- Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
- Query params:
  - `access_token` (string, required)
- Request body (JSON):
  - `name` (string, required)
  - `advertiser_id` (number, required)
  - Optional: `start_date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `end_date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `max_impression_count` (number), `display_type` (`no_repeat` | `allow_repeat_campaign` | `allow_repeat_advertisement` | `force_repeat_campaign`), `active` (boolean), `weight` (number), `path` (string), `archived` (boolean), `pacing_type` (`asap` | `even`), `impression_max_type` (`cap` | `goal`), `paused` (boolean), `notes` (string)

Example cURL
```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://api.broadstreetads.com/api/1/campaigns?access_token=$BROADSTREET_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Fall Promo",
    "advertiser_id": 12345,
    "start_date": "2025-10-01",
    "weight": 100,
    "pacing_type": "asap"
  }'
```

Example response (201 Created)
```json
{
  "campaign": {
    "id": 67890,
    "name": "Fall Promo",
    "advertiser_id": 12345,
    "start_date": "2025-10-01",
    "end_date": null,
    "weight": 100,
    "display_type": "no_repeat",
    "active": true,
    "path": "",
    "archived": false,
    "pacing_type": "asap",
    "impression_max_type": "cap",
    "paused": false,
    "notes": ""
  }
}
```

TypeScript example (using our API helper)
```ts
import broadstreetAPI from '@/lib/broadstreet-api';

const created = await broadstreetAPI.createCampaign({
  name: 'Fall Promo',
  advertiser_id: 12345,
  start_date: '2025-10-01',
  weight: 100,
  pacing_type: 'asap',
});

// created => { broadstreet_id, name, advertiser_id, start_date, ... }
```

Create locally (in-app, recommended during testing)
- Open the Campaigns page and click the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù button ‚Üí choose Campaign to open the Add Campaign modal.
- The modal requires both a network and an advertiser selected in the sidebar; it uses those selections to set `network_id` and `advertiser_id`.
- On submit, it calls our local endpoint `POST /api/create/campaign` and stores the campaign as unsynced (`created_locally: true`, `synced_with_api: false`).

Local endpoint example
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/create/campaign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Fall Promo",
    "network_id": 85,
    "advertiser_id": 12345,
    "start_date": "2025-10-01",
    "weight": 100,
    "display_type": "no_repeat",
    "pacing_type": "asap"
  }'
```

Local endpoint example (with a LOCAL advertiser)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/create/campaign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Fall Promo",
    "network_id": 85,
    "advertiser": { "mongo_id": "68c87564d49cd5ae18663ccf" },
    "start_date": "2025-10-01",
    "weight": 100,
    "pacing_type": "asap"
  }'
```

Notes about local advertisers
- The creation endpoint accepts either `advertiser_id` (number) or `advertiser` object with `broadstreet_id` or `mongo_id`.
- If the advertiser is local, pass `advertiser.mongo_id`. We store `advertiser_id` internally as that string until sync.
- The campaigns list endpoint `GET /api/campaigns?advertiser_id=...` accepts a numeric Broadstreet ID or a MongoDB ObjectId string and filters accordingly.

What you should see after creating locally
- Campaigns page: the new campaign card shows a "üè† Local" badge and uses local card styling.
- Local Only page: the campaign appears under ‚ÄúCampaigns‚Äù with a "Local Only" status badge, ready to sync.
- Data flags: item is saved with `created_locally: true` and `synced_with_api: false` until synced.

Add Campaign modal data mapping
- Required: `name`, a selected network (`network_id` from sidebar), a selected advertiser (`advertiser_id` or `advertiser.mongo_id` from sidebar), `start_date`, and `weight`.
- Optional fields sent only if provided: `end_date`, `max_impression_count`, `display_type` (defaults to `no_repeat`), `pacing_type` (defaults to `asap`), `archived`, `paused`, `notes`.

Notes
- Pass `access_token` in the query string; the API expects it there.
- A 401 indicates an invalid or missing token. Ensure `BROADSTREET_API_TOKEN` is set.
- Dates are normalized to `YYYY-MM-DD` when syncing to Broadstreet.
- Name uniqueness is not enforced globally; check per-advertiser duplicates as needed.

## Sync a local campaign to Broadstreet

In-app steps
- Go to Local Only ‚Üí Campaigns section.
- Click ‚ÄúSync All to Broadstreet‚Äù to sync all local entities for the selected network. Campaigns will be synced after advertisers and zones.
- Alternatively, from the Campaigns page ensure your network and advertiser are selected, then run a sync from the Local Only page.

API (sync all local entities for a network)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sync/local-all \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "networkId": 85
  }'
```

What happens
- A dry run validates duplicates and dependencies.
- If valid, the service creates missing entities in Broadstreet. For campaigns, it sends `name`, `advertiser_id`, and optional fields like `start_date`, `weight`, `pacing_type`, etc., when present.
- On success, the local campaign is updated with `broadstreet_id`, `synced_with_api: true`, and `synced_at`.

## How to update a campaign

## Pre-requisites
- access token - found in the .env file
- advertiser id
  - In-app creation: comes from the advertiser you select in the sidebar; the Add Campaign modal reads it automatically.
  - API usage: the numeric Broadstreet `advertiser_id`. Obtain by listing advertisers or from stored advertisers where `Advertiser.id` equals the Broadstreet ID.

**CRITICAL**
- if a value is not required and it is not provided, it will not be included in the request body.
- other than the id, we never rely on another id.
- when we open a campaign creation form, we DO NOT have a campaign id. We also dont give it any. We do that only on save.
- fields required by the broadstreet api that are required need to present. They are almost always in the filters section of the sidebar. e.g. network id and advertiser id are required. If not present, give message.
- in campaign duplicate names are allowed.

**HANDLING LOCAL ADVERTISERS AND CAMPAIGNS**
- we may create local advertisers. they will not have a broadstreet_id, being local. so we just use the mongo_id. later the sync will update the broadstreet_id.
