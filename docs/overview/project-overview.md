# Project Overview

Broadstreet Campaigns is a dual-database application that syncs entities from the Broadstreet API into local MongoDB, while supporting local-only workflows prior to upload.

Key components
- Dashboard with explicit sync actions (no background polling)
- Entity management for Networks, Advertisers, Zones, Campaigns, Advertisements, and Placements
- Local-only entities maintained separately until uploaded
