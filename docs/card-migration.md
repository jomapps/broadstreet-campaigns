# Entity Card Migration

## Overview
We have different cards for different entities and different pages. We want to migrate to a single card component that can be used for all entities and pages.

## Card Design Reference
[Card Design Reference](docs/desgin-reference/card-design.md)
**CRITCAL** no fallbacks, no mockdata, no legacy compatibility.
**CRITICAL** App is working fine so it should not break.

## Migration Plan
start with phases for each type of entity. get approval from user. then move to next.
