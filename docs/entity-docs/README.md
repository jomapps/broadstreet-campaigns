## Common Patterns

All entity creation forms follow the same proven pattern established with Zone creation:

### Form Structure
1. **Required Fields**: Only essential fields at the top
2. **Collapsible Sections**: Optional fields organized in expandable sections
3. **Dual Submit Buttons**: Quick submission at top and bottom
4. **Auto-adjusting Height**: Modal resizes based on content
5. **Clean Payload**: Only sends fields with actual values

### Validation
- Real-time validation with user-friendly error messages
- Required field validation
- Format validation (URLs, emails, dates)
- Unique constraint validation within network

### Sync Process
1. **Local Creation**: Entities created in local collections
2. **API Validation**: Real Broadstreet API calls with response validation
3. **Entity Movement**: Successfully synced entities moved to main collections
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of sync failures
