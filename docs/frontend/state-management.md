# State Management (Frontend)

Zustand is the canonical state layer. Always follow patterns in:
- ../implementation/zustand-implementation.md

Highlights
- Use new documented patterns only; do not mix older approaches
- Property names: e.g., `selectedNetwork` (not `selectedNetworkId`)
- Theme selection: selecting a theme clears current zones and sets the themeâ€™s zones as selected

Cross-links
- Sidebar filters behavior: ./sidebar-filters.md
- Variable origins registry: ../variable-origins.md
