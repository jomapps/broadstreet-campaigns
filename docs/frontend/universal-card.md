# Universal Card

Purpose
- Single card implementation that supports all entity variants consistently

Requirements
- Show IDs consistently: prefer explicit `broadstreet_id` or `_id` (Mongo) as per ../entity-reference/ids.md
- Local-only: show small local badge; yellowish card treatment
- Placement cards must include campaign name/id, ad name/id, and zone name/id
- Breadcrumbs wrap instead of truncating

Cross-links
- UI preferences: ../conventions/ui-preferences.md
- IDs canonical: ../entity-reference/ids.md
